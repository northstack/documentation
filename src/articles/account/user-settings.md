# Changing User Settings

Inside the NorthStack Console, there are two different parts that make up an account: organizations and users. When you log into your account, you're logging in as a user who is part of a larger organization.

When logged into the NorthStack Console, you'll notice your name with an icon at the top-right of the page. Click on your **user icon**, then on **User Settings** to access the settings for your user.

You'll now be on the *User Settings* page. From here, you can make changes to your account such as changing your email, enabling two-factor authentication, or changing your password.
