# Installing the Gatsby CLI

## Requirements

* [Node.js/NPM](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installing Gatsby

Since the Gatsby CLI uses NPM, installing it is a breeze. Just run the following command in a terminal window to install the Gatsby CLI system-wide:

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

That's all there is to it! To make sure it's working, you can run the following:

```shell
gatsby --help
```
